        "## 1. Sigmoid Activation Function\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Sigmoid** activation function, also known as the logistic function, is one of the most commonly used nonlinear activation functions in neural networks. It is defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\[\n",
        "f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\n",
        "\\]\n",
        "\n",
        "### Characteristics of the Sigmoid Activation Function:\n",
        "- **Range**: The output of the Sigmoid function is always between 0 and 1, i.e., \\( f(x) \\in (0, 1) \\). This makes it particularly useful for binary classification tasks, where the output represents a probability.\n",
        "- **Smooth Gradient**: The function is differentiable, which is useful for backpropagation in training neural networks.\n",
        "- **Monotonic**: The Sigmoid function is monotonic, meaning that it always increases as the input increases.\n",
        "- **Nonlinear**: It introduces nonlinearity, allowing the network to learn complex relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Common Use Cases:\n",
        "- **Output Layer in Binary Classification**: Sigmoid is often used in the output layer for binary classification problems because it outputs a probability-like value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as the likelihood of a given input belonging to a particular class.\n",
        "- **Hidden Layers**: While Sigmoid was historically used in hidden layers, it is less common now due to some issues that have been identified.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Potential Challenges:\n",
        "- **Vanishing Gradients**: For very large or very small input values, the derivative of the Sigmoid function becomes very small. This leads to the **vanishing gradient problem**, where gradients approach zero during backpropagation, making learning slow or even impossible in deep networks.\n",
        "- **Not Zero-Centered**: Since the output range is between 0 and 1, the output of the Sigmoid function is always positive, which can cause issues during gradient descent optimization.\n",

        "\n",
        "## 2. Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) Activation Function\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)** is another popular activation function, defined as:\n",

        "- **Nonlinearity**: Although it is a simple function, it is nonlinear, allowing the neural network to learn complex patterns.\n",
        "- **Computationally Efficient**: ReLU is easy to compute, as it only involves a comparison with zero.\n",
        "- **Differentiable**: ReLU is piecewise differentiable, but its derivative is not defined at exactly \\( x = 0 \\). In practice, this does not create significant problems during optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Advantages of ReLU:\n",
        "- **Faster Training**: ReLU tends to converge faster than Sigmoid or Tanh due to its simpler form and better gradient propagation (not susceptible to vanishing gradients for positive inputs).\n",
        "- **Sparsity**: ReLU creates sparse activations (many neurons will output 0), which helps in building efficient models and reducing overfitting.\n",
        "- **Better Gradient Propagation**: Unlike Sigmoid and Tanh, ReLU does not suffer from vanishing gradients for positive values of \\( x \\), making it suitable for deep networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Potential Challenges of ReLU:\n",
        "- **Dead Neurons**: For negative input values, ReLU outputs 0, meaning neurons can become \"inactive\" and stop learning, a phenomenon called \"dead neurons.\" If too many neurons output 0, the network may not learn properly.\n",
        "- **Unbounded Output**: Since the output of ReLU can grow indefinitely, it can cause issues with exploding gradients, especially in very deep networks.\n",
        "\n",

Without them, the network would only be able to learn linear transformations, which is very limiting.\n",

        "1. **Introducing Non-Linearity**:\n",
        "   - Activation functions like **ReLU**, **sigmoid**, or **tanh** allow the network to learn non-linear mappings between inputs and outputs. Without these functions, no matter how many layers the network has, it would behave like a single-layer linear model.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Learning Complex Patterns**:\n",
        "   - Hidden layers in a neural network are responsible for extracting higher-level features from the data. For example, early layers in an image classification network might learn basic features like edges, while deeper layers learn more complex features like shapes and objects.\n",
        "   - The activation function helps make these transformations more powerful and expressive by allowing each neuron to represent more complex features of the data.\n",
